Note
Before beginning the project, download AB_NYC_2019.csv download

Place the file in your PyCharm projects folder, the same folder that contains your code.

Objective
Demonstrate an understanding of:

File I/O
Unit Tests
Specification
Create a new global string object called filename.  Set filename equal to:

'./AB_NYC_2019.csv' (for Mac/Linux)
'AB_NYC_2019.csv' (for Windows)
Create a new method in the DataSet class called load_file().  This method should load all the data from the Airbnb data file into self._data.  Use the global filename object to specify the file to open.  The function should report how many lines are loaded.

Update option 8 in the menu to call load_file() instead of load_default_data().

Optional - Extra Credit (5 points):
Create a separate file and write a unit test using the unittest module.  At a minimum, verify that 48895 lines of Airbnb data were loaded.  Your unit test must use the techniques in the Advanced Unit Testing module.

Sample Run
Your sample run should be used to verify that all properties are loaded.  It is sufficient to load the file and display the data from menu option 1.  You must verify that the calculations made by your code match the results below.  Also make sure your tables still look good!
