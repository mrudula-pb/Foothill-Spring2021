Objective

Demonstrate an understanding of:

While Loops
Break and Continue
Specification

Start with your code from assignment two.

Modify the menu() function as follows:

Printing of the menu and asking for user input should be in a loop, so the user can continue making other selections.  This should be accomplished with a while loop.  Be careful that you do not call menu() from inside the menu() function!
Modify the try/except/else section so there is not an else block (it is fine to have other else blocks in the function).  There's nothing wrong with the way we coded this in assignment two, but it is more common to skip the else block in a case like this.  Be careful, though, we also can't continue execution if the user entered a string rather than a variable.  Think about everything we learned about while loops, and figure out a way to skip the rest of the statements without exiting the loop.
Modify selection 9 so that it exits the loop and says goodbye to the user.  You should use keywords we have learned related to loops.  You should not use something like return or sys.exit()...we haven't learned about those yet.
Other Requirements

Same as assignment two...

Input and output should be well organized, with correct spacing and punctuation.  Style counts!

There should be a module level docstring, and a docstring for every function.

Follow the PEP-8 conventions you have learned so far.

Your sample run does not have to show ALL options, but should at least show what happens in at least two cases where the user chooses a valid option, one case where the user types an invalid integer, and one case where the user types something other than an integer.

Sample Run (your output can be different as long as it meets the criteria above)
