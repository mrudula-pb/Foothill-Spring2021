# Write a Python function named max that takes a parameter containing a nonempty list of integers and returns the
# maximum value. (Note: there is a builtin function named max but pretend you cannot use it.)

    for first in myList:
        for second in myList[1:]:
            pass

    pass


myList = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
