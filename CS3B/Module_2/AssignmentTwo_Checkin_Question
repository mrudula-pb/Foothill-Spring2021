This assignment is a check-in for Assignment Two.  For details on the specs, please see Assignment Two.  At this point you should at least have made the changes to __init__(), and have split_set() functioning correctly.

Run the unit test below and include the results.

def unit_test():
    errors = False
    try:
        # Create a valid small and large dataset to be used later
        x = list(range(10))
        y = x
        our_data_0 = NNData(x, y)
        print(our_data_0._features)
        x = list(range(100))
        y = x
        our_big_data = NNData(x, y, .5)


    except:
        print("There are errors that likely come from __init__ or a "
              "method called by __init__")
        errors = True

    # Test split_set to make sure the correct number of samples are in
    # each set, and that the indices do not overlap.
    try:
        our_data_0.split_set(.3)
        assert len(our_data_0._train_indices) == 3
        assert len(our_data_0._test_indices) == 7
        assert (list(set(our_data_0._train_indices +
                         our_data_0._test_indices))) == list(range(10))
    except:
        print("There are errors that likely come from split_set")
        errors = True  # Summary
    if errors:
        print("You have one or more errors.  Please fix them before "
              "submitting")
    else:
        print("No errors were identified by the unit test.")
        print("You should still double check that your code meets spec.")
        print("You should also check that PyCharm does not identify any "
              "PEP-8 issues.")
